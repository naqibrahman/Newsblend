(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda, File)            </p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI failed to notify scores of U.S. officials that Russian hackers were trying to break into their personal Gmail accounts despite having evidence for at least a year that the targets were in the Kremlin's crosshairs, The Associated Press has found.</p><p>Nearly 80 interviews with Americans targeted by Fancy Bear, a Russian government-aligned cyberespionage group, turned up only two cases in which the FBI had provided a heads-up. Even senior policymakers discovered they were targets only when the AP told them, a situation some described as bizarre and dispiriting.</p><p>"It's utterly confounding," said Philip Reiner, a former senior director at the National Security Council, who was notified by the AP that he was targeted in 2015. "You've got to tell your people. You've got to protect your people."</p><p>FBI policy calls for notifying victims, whether individuals or groups, to help thwart both ongoing and future hacking attempts. The policy, which was disclosed in a lawsuit filed earlier this year against the FBI by the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center, says that notification should be considered "even when it may interfere with another investigation or (intelligence) operation."</p><p>Last week, the FBI declined to discuss its investigation into Fancy Bear's spying campaign, but did provide a statement that said in part: "The FBI routinely notifies individuals and organizations of potential threat information."</p><p>Three people familiar with the matter — including a current and a former government official — said the FBI has known for more than a year the details of Fancy Bear's attempts to break into Gmail inboxes. A senior FBI official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the hacking operation because of its sensitivity, declined to comment on when it received the target list, but said that the bureau was overwhelmed by the sheer number of attempted hacks.</p><p>"It's a matter of triaging to the best of our ability the volume of the targets who are out there," he said.</p><p>In the face of a tidal wave of malicious phishing attempts, the FBI sometimes passes on information about the attacks to service providers and companies, who can then relay information to clients or employees, he added.</p><p>The AP did its own triage, dedicating two months and a small team of reporters to go through a hit list of Fancy Bear targets provided by the cybersecurity firm Secureworks.</p><p>Previous AP investigations based on the list have shown how Fancy Bear <a href="https://apnews.com/3bca5267d4544508bb523fa0db462cb2/Hit-list-exposes-Russian-hacking-beyond-US-elections">worked in close alignment with the Kremlin's interests</a> to <a href="https://apnews.com/dea73efc01594839957c3c9a6c962b8a/Inside-story:-How-Russians-hacked-the-Democrats%27-emails">steal tens of thousands of emails from the Democratic Party</a> . The hacking campaign disrupted the 2016 U.S. election and cast a shadow over the presidency of Donald Trump, whom U.S. intelligence agencies say <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf">the hackers were trying to help</a> . The Russian government has denied interfering in the American election.</p><p>The Secureworks list comprises <a href="https://medium.com/@rsatter/tracing-fancy-bears-paw-prints-6f17e6b82fa4">19,000 lines of targeting data</a> . Going through it, the AP identified more than 500 U.S.-based people or groups and reached out to more than 190 of them, interviewing nearly 80 about their experiences.</p><p>Many were long-retired, but about one-quarter were still in government or held security clearances at the time they were targeted. Only two told the AP they learned of the hacking attempts on their personal Gmail accounts from the FBI. A few more were contacted by the FBI after their emails were published in the torrent of leaks that coursed through last year's electoral contest. But to this day, some leak victims have not heard from the bureau at all.</p><p>Charles Sowell, who previously worked as a senior administrator in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and was targeted by Fancy Bear two years ago, said there was no reason the FBI couldn't do the same work the AP did.</p><p>"It's absolutely not OK for them to use an excuse that there's too much data," Sowell said. "Would that hold water if there were a serial killer investigation, and people were calling in tips left and right, and they were holding up their hands and saying, 'It's too much'? That's ridiculous."</p><p>___</p><p>"IT'S CURIOUS"</p><p>The AP found few traces of the bureau's inquiry as it launched its own investigation two months ago.</p><p>In October, two AP journalists visited <a href="https://www.thcservers.com/">THCServers.com</a> , a brightly lit, family-run internet company on the former grounds of a communist-era chicken farm outside the Romanian city of Craiova. That's where someone registered DCLeaks.com, the first of three websites to publish caches of emails belonging to Democrats and other U.S. officials in mid-2016.</p><p>DCLeaks was clearly linked to Fancy Bear. Previous AP reporting found that all but one of the site's victims had been targeted by the hacking group before their emails were dumped online.</p><p>Yet THC founder Catalin Florica said he was never approached by law enforcement.</p><p>"It's curious," Florica said. "You are the first ones that contact us."</p><p>THC merely registered the site, a simple process that typically takes only a few minutes. But the reaction was similar at the Kuala Lumpur offices of the Malaysian web company <a href="https://www.shinjiru.com.my/">Shinjiru Technology</a> , which hosted DCLeaks' stolen files for the duration of the electoral campaign.</p><p>The company's chief executive, Terence Choong, said he had never heard of DCLeaks until the AP contacted him.</p><p>"What is the issue with it?" he asked.</p><p>Questions over the FBI's handling of Fancy Bear's broad hacking sweep date to March 2016, when agents arrived unannounced at Hillary Clinton's headquarters in Brooklyn to warn her campaign about a surge of rogue, password-stealing emails.</p><p>The agents offered little more than generic security tips the campaign had already put into practice and refused to say who they thought was behind the attempted intrusions, according to a person who was there and spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversation was meant to be confidential.</p><p>Questions emerged again after it was revealed that the FBI never took custody of the Democratic National Committee's computer server after it was penetrated by Fancy Bear in April 2016. Former FBI Director James Comey testified this year that the FBI worked off a copy of the server, which he described as an "appropriate substitute."</p><p>___</p><p>"MAKES ME SAD"</p><p>Retired Maj. James Phillips was one of the first people to have the contents of his inbox published by DCLeaks when the website made its June 2016 debut.</p><p>But the Army veteran said he didn't realize his personal emails were "flapping in the breeze" until a journalist phoned him two months later.</p><p>"The fact that a reporter told me about DCLeaks kind of makes me sad," he said. "I wish it had been a government source."</p><p>Phillips' story would be repeated again and again as the AP spoke to officials from the National Defense University in Washington to the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado.</p><p>Among them: a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, retired Lt. Gen. Patrick Hughes; a former head of Air Force Intelligence, retired Lt. Gen. David Deptula; a former defense undersecretary, Eric Edelman; and a former director of cybersecurity for the Air Force, retired Lt. Gen. Mark Schissler.</p><p>Retired Maj. Gen. Brian Keller, a former director of military support at the Geospatial Intelligence Agency, was not informed, even after DCLeaks posted his emails to the internet. In a telephone call with AP, Keller said he still wasn't clear on what had happened, who had hacked him or whether his data was still at risk.</p><p>"Should I be worried or alarmed or anything?" asked Keller, who left the spy satellite agency in 2010 and now works in private industry.</p><p>Not all the interviewees felt the FBI had a responsibility to alert them.</p><p>"Perhaps optimistically, I have to conclude that a risk analysis was done and I was not considered a high enough risk to justify making contact," said a former Air Force chief of staff, retired Gen. Norton Schwartz, who was targeted by Fancy Bear in 2015.</p><p>Others argued that the FBI may have wanted to avoid tipping the hackers off or that there were too many people to notify.</p><p>"The expectation that the government is going to protect everyone and go back to everyone is false," said Nicholas Eftimiades, a retired senior technical officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency who teaches homeland security at Pennsylvania State University in Harrisburg and was himself among the targets.</p><p>But the government is supposed to try, said Michael Daniel, who served as President Barack Obama's White House cybersecurity coordinator.</p><p>Daniel wouldn't comment directly on why so many Fancy Bear targets weren't warned in this case, but he said the issue of how and when to notify people "frankly still needs more work."</p><p>___</p><p>"CLOAK-AND-DAGGER"</p><p>In the absence of any official warning, some of those contacted by AP brushed off the idea that they were taken in by a foreign power's intelligence service.</p><p>"I don't open anything I don't recognize," said Joseph Barnard, who headed the personnel recovery branch of the Air Force's Air Combat Command.</p><p>That may well be true of Barnard; Secureworks' data suggests he never clicked the malicious link sent to him in June 2015. But it isn't true of everyone.</p><p>An AP analysis of the data suggests that out of 312 U.S. military and government figures targeted by Fancy Bear, 131 clicked the links sent to them. That could mean that as many as 2 in 5 came perilously close to handing over their passwords.</p><p>It's not clear how many gave up their credentials in the end or what the hackers may have acquired.</p><p>Some of those accounts hold emails that go back years, when even many of the retired officials still occupied sensitive posts.</p><p>Overwhelmingly, interviewees told AP they kept classified material out of their Gmail inboxes, but intelligence experts said Russian spies could use personal correspondence as a springboard for further hacking, recruitment or even blackmail.</p><p>"You start to have information you might be able to leverage against that person," said Sina Beaghley, a researcher at the RAND Corp. who served on the NSC until 2014.</p><p>In the few cases where the FBI did warn targets, they were sometimes left little wiser about what was going on or what to do.</p><p>Rob "Butch" Bracknell, a 20-year military veteran who now works in Norfolk, Virginia, said an FBI agent visited him about a year ago to examine his emails and warn him that a "foreign actor" was trying to break into his account.</p><p>"He was real cloak-and-dagger about it," Bracknell said. "He came here to my work, wrote in his little notebook and away he went."</p><p>Left to fend for themselves, some targets have been improvising their cybersecurity.</p><p>Retired Gen. Roger A. Brady, who was responsible for American nuclear weapons in Europe as part of his past role as commander of the U.S. Air Force there, turned to Apple support this year when he noticed something suspicious on his computer. Hughes, a former DIA head, said he had his hard drive replaced by the "Geek Squad" at a Best Buy in Florida after his machine began behaving strangely. Keller, the former senior spy satellite official, said it was his son who told him his emails had been posted to the web after getting a Google alert in June 2016.</p><p>A former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, who like many others was repeatedly targeted by Fancy Bear but has yet to receive any warning from the FBI, said the lackluster response risked something worse than last year's parade of leaks.</p><p>"Our government needs to be taking greater responsibility to defend its citizens in both the physical and cyber worlds, now, before a cyberattack produces an even more catastrophic outcome than we have already experienced," McFaul said.</p><p>___</p><p>Donn reported from Plymouth, Massachusetts.

This week, some of its earliest practitioners and many of the world's top AI researchers are in Long Beach, CA, for the field's big annual gathering—<a href="https://nips.cc/" target="_blank">the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference</a>. In all, some 7,700 people are to attend AI's version of high tech's glitzy South by Southwest conference, and the electronic device industry's even bigger annual CES conference.</p><p>It's NIPS' 31st year in what originally drew just a few hundred participants — computer scientists, physicists, mathematicians and neuroscientists all interested in AI. Terrence Sejnowski, a computational neuroscientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and president of the NIPS Foundation, spoke with Axios about growth in the field and what's next.</p><p><strong>How machine learning has grown since NIPS' start in the '80s:</strong> "Over that period what happened was a convergence of a number of different factors, one of them being the fact that computers got a million times faster. Back then we could only study little toy networks with a few hundred units. But now we can study networks with millions of units. The other thing was the training sets — you need to have examples of what it is you're trying to learn. The internet made it possible for us to get millions of training examples relatively easily, because there's so many images, abundant speech examples, and so forth, that you can download from the internet. Finally, there were breakthroughs along the way in the algorithms that we used to make them more efficient. We understood them a lot better in terms of something called <em>regularization</em>, which is how to keep the network from memorizing — you want it to generalize."<br/></p><p><strong>The role of hardware: "</strong>By far, right now, the most exciting part of the hardware development is special purpose digital chips that speed up and are able to enhance the learning. That is to say, the bottleneck right now for learning is the fact that you have to give it many examples. Basically it's applying the same simple operation over and over again.</p><p>"What's happened is that Nvidia and Intel, and a dozen other startup companies, are designing special purpose learning chips. Actually, Google already has one that's called TPU, tensor processing unit, which they're using in the cloud because of the fact that it's much more efficient in terms of the energy use and the speed. Without it they wouldn't have been able to roll out services using deep learning — things like language translation. There's literally billions of dollars that are being invested right now in digital hardware.</p><p>"The problem though is that, of course, if you want to put it into a cell phone you have to make it very low power. The next generation will be even lower power chips using analog VLSI [very-large-scale-integration]. That's being driven by the applications and the technology. The cell phone market is huge, we're talking about billions of chips out there that can be put into cell phones."</p><p><strong>The coming challenge:</strong> "We can now put a million units with a billion connections and train it to do something. If you look in the brain, that's about five square millimeters of the cortex. What will eventually happen — and it is happening — is that we know that each part of the cortex is specialized for a different function. Each little patch, very tiny patch, has been dedicated to all these different functions, which we know are separate networks and are doing separate tasks, which is kind of a modular approach.</p><p>"If you look into the way the cortex works it's really interesting because all these areas are interconnected with each other. It's not like they're isolated from each other. Right? There are long range, and there are short range connections. The big challenge is the global organization of all of these, right now, modular networks that have been designed for one task each network. It'll happen. It's beginning to happen but it will require theoretical advances for how to organize all the information that is distributed over the entire cortex.</p><p>"This is a very exciting area in neuroscience right now because we have tools and techniques, like brain imaging, that we can actually see that happening, both during learning and also during memory consolidation during sleep. As we learn more about how the cortex organizes information globally, it should be possible to translate that into a global workplace built out of all of these chips that are being designed for all these special applications."</p><p>"There are a lot of other problems too, but it seems to me that the integration problem may be the key to general intelligence. That's something people like to talk about. They say, 'Oh, you solved these little applications but you haven't figured out how to get much more flexible behavior that involves integrating all that information.' My guess is that if we could figure out how the brain solves the global integration problem, we'll be on our way to understanding a little bit more about general intelligence."</p><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/tech-giants-are-fighting-to-hire-the-best-ai-talent-at-the-nips-conference-this-week-2017-12" target="_blank">NIPS is one of the AI hiring events of the year</a> (Business Insider), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-setup-image-recognition-ai-lets-program-think-its-feet?tgt=nr" target="_blank">a new approach to image recognition is being presented by AI pioneer Geoff Hinton </a>(ScienceNews) and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/609667/nvidias-tag-teaming-ais-imagine-night-as-day-and-house-cats-as-tigers/" target="_blank">a daydreaming AI</a> (MIT Technology Review).<br/></p><p>Romney leaves following a meeting with President-elect Trump about the Secretary of State vacancy.

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has been one of bitcoin’s most prominent detractors, calling it a fraud and deriding buyers as “stupid,” while his finance chief, Marianne Lake, has struck a more measured tone.

It's a venerable brand known for its service and  iconic blue planes.</p><p>  Since 2014, Pieter Elbers has been the man tasked with leading  the Dutch national airline into the future. Elbers joined KLM in  1992 as an aircraft-loading supervisor before moving up the  company's management ladder. Today, the charismatic 47-year-old  leads an airline with 33,000 employees and $12 billion in annual  revenue.</p><p>  Elbers recently sat down with Business Insider at our  headquarters in New York. Our conversation touched on several  topics, including the Air France-KLM union, competition in the  marketplace, and travel tips.</p><p>  In 2004, KLM merged with Air France to form one of Europe's  largest and most powerful aviation conglomerates with a fleet of  more than 530 planes that carry more than 93 million passengers  annually.</p><p>  Because of labor issues and the hypercompetitive nature of the  Europe's commercial-aviation industry, things have not always  been easy for Air France-KLM. However, the company has reported  $1.2 billion in profit through the first three quarters of this  year.</p><p>  "What I share with my staff is that we aren't following the book  on consolidation — we are writing the book on consolidation,"  Elbers said. "And sure, sometimes we have to make changes or  reverse some earlier decisions. It's nice to play a role in it."</p><p><span class="KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image" data-post-image=""><img alt="Air France" data-mce-source="REUTERS/Benoit Tessier" src="http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/581b5832362ca44a018b6b0d-1778/rtx2rq01.jpg"/><span class="source-only source">REUTERS/Benoit Tessier</span></span></p><p>  According to Elbers, the interplay between the two airlines is  constructive.</p><p>  "In the past, we were probably very much that we should  centralize a lot of activities in service to these two airlines,"  he said. "In today's reality, for instance, in the field of  digitalization, we prefer to do it in both Amsterdam and Paris.</p><p>  "And then to make sure people challenge each other, help each  other, share best practices, and share ideas," Elbers continued.  "We see a great momentum there in terms of if something is being  done on the Air France side, the KLM guys know they can learn  from that and try the same thing or even work to improve it."</p><p>  The most disruptive force to hit commercial aviation over the  past two decades is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/best-low-cost-airline-world-skytrax-air-asia-norwegian-jetblue-2017-6">  low-cost airlines</a>, such as AirAsia or <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/wow-air-ceo-airlines-will-soon-pay-you-to-fly-2017-7">  WOW Air</a>. However, Elbers says legacy carriers underestimated  their effect until it was too late.</p><p>  "My personal view is that for especially the first decade of  their existence, network carriers like ourselves sort of  underestimated, ignored — almost arrogantly ignored — the rise of  low-cost carriers," Elbers said. "With that, we can see that  their share in the European landscape has steadily increased and  is now anywhere between 42% and 45% of all flights in Europe are  with low-cost carriers, and a percentage which is significantly  larger than in the US, where it's about a third."</p><p>  In response, KLM has made drastic changes to the way it conducts  business.</p><p>  "With that, we have embarked on a program in KLM a few years ago  whereby we sort of said, 'We're going to defend our European  network, and we're going to make sure that we do the right thing  for our customers on the European network,'" he said.</p><p>  "So we have lowered our cost. We have increased our fleet  utilization. We have changed our commercial offers on probably  60% of all our European destinations, which are about 80  destinations. We do have levels which are matching the low-cost  carriers. So this combination of cost-cutting on the one-hand  side, investing in our product and our service."</p><p><span class="KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image" data-post-image=""><img alt="klm plane biofuel powered" data-mce-source="KLM" src="http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/513e1f406bb3f78764000011-2400/90-5.jpg"/><span class="source-only source">KLM</span></span></p><p>  However, low-cost carriers aren't the only competitive threats to  legacy airlines. In countries such as China and Japan, high-speed  rail services have taken a toll on domestic air travel. But  Elbers says that hasn't been an issue for KLM.</p><p>  "High-speed rail internationally in Europe is a very, very small  number," he said. "Domestically, in countries like France, it is  relevant. Between various countries, it's hardly relevant because  of all of the different systems. It's not really taking traffic."</p><p>  Things are different when it comes to the three Persian Gulf  mega-carriers: Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways. This has been  a point of contention, as US and European carriers have accused  them of being propped up by more than $50 billion in government  subsidies.</p><p>  "The fact that we have new competition is not an issue, but what  the aviation community has been rather vocal about is to ensure  that we have a level playing field and that we all play by the  same rules," Elbers said. "I think it's very important also as a  commitment to our staff: If we ask them to make sacrifices and to  contribute to the change and the well-being of the company, we  should be able to do that while fighting on an even playing  field."</p><p>  Elbers is on a plane several times a month, and as a result, he  has worked out a few tricks to make air travel easier — for  instance, he stresses the importance of organization when it  comes to packing.</p><p><span class="KonaFilter image-container display-table image on-image" data-post-image=""><img alt="KLM Boeing 777 300ER" data-mce-source="KLM" src="http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5a18f5a9f914c347018b603e-2000/patrickkopb777bvsaankomst230217-13447d-2.jpg"/><span class="source-only source">KLM</span></span></p><p>  "Everything is in a fixed place. Everything is packed in the same  way. I'm boarding an aircraft about every other week, so I want  to make sure I don't forget anything," he said. "I need  everything to be done in the very same way. I know where  everything is packed. I know the sequence of packing it. So yes,  I do it in the same very structured way."</p><p>  He added: "What I do is I have a special bag for sort of my  running stuff and some of the non-business-related items. And  then I have a small carry-on luggage for business shirts, ties,  and so on."</p><p>  For Elbers, combatting jet lag is all about exercise to start the  day.</p><p>  "Beating jet lag for me is an early-morning run," he said. "So,  wherever I go, I wake up early, I do my run, and that's, for me,  the way to beat the jet lag."</p><p>Pieter Elbers has been the CEO of the Dutch...</p><p><a class="title-link concierge-post-link" href=""></a></p><p><a class="title" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-x-1-trillion-company-2017-11">How the iPhone X could make Apple a $1 trillion company</a></p><p class="align-right"><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-bottom-line">More "The Bottom Line" »</a> </p><p><a class="title" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mary-claire-king-and-the-impact-brca-genes-had-on-cancer-genetics-2017-11">Over a 40-year career, this 'stubborn scientist' helped change the way we think about cancer and genetics</a></p><p class="align-right"><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/category/the-long-view">More "The Long View" »</a> </p><p>Get the best of Business Insider delivered to your inbox every day.</p><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/intelligence/ignition-2017-the-14-most-important-trends-in-media?IR=Tutm_source=businessinsider&amp;utm_medium=rr&amp;utm_campaign=future-of-retailbirr&amp;utm_term=birr" target="_blank"> <img alt="2017 Ignition deck" border="0" src="https://static-ssl.businessinsider.com/image/5a2570b78fe4de3fa09b639d-300/2017-ignition-deck.png"/></a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p style="text-align: center;"><span>Available on iOS or Android</span></p>""",
